The nuScenes dataset (pronounced /nuːsiːnz/) is a public large-scale dataset for autonomous driving developed by Aptiv Autonomous Mobility (formerly nuTonomy). By releasing a subset of our data to the public, Aptiv aims to support public research into computer vision and autonomous driving.

For this purpose we collected 1000 driving scenes in Boston and Singapore, two cities that are known for their dense traffic and highly challenging driving situations. The scenes of 20 second length are manually selected to show a diverse and interesting set of driving maneuvers, traffic situations and unexpected behaviors. The rich complexity of nuScenes will encourage development of methods that enable safe driving in urban areas with dozens of objects per scene. Gathering data on different continents further allows us to study the generalization of computer vision algorithms across different locations, weather conditions, vehicle types, vegetation, road markings and left versus right hand traffic.
